Homomorphic Tools
===========

Explorations in partially homomorphic cryptography, searching for applications for blockchains.

[cryptographic primitives](basics.erl)
[an rsa accumulator](rsa_accumulator.erl)
[example of an elliptic curve with small numbers](elliptic.erl)
[secp256k1 elliptic curve implementation. The same curve as is used for bitcoin signatures](secp256k1.erl)
[using pedersen commitments to make bullet proofs and inner product arguments](pedersen_tree.erl)
[polynomial commitment tools. An example of doing a zero knowledge computation by converting the computation to a rank 1 constaint system, and using inner product arguments to show the validity of an encrypted witness.](polynomial_commitments.erl)
